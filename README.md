### Data Loading

An independent script is used to load the Zomato restaurant data into a MySQL database. The script, located in the `Config.java` file of the backend, scrapes JSON and CSV files and loads the data accordingly. The file path is:
```
server/src/main/java/com/zomato/zomato_app/config/Config.java
```

### User Interface
Developed a web application with the following pages, which must connect to the web API service:


#### Restaurant List Page
Displays a list of restaurants. Clicking on a restaurant should navigate the user to the restaurant's detail page.

### Location Search
Searches restaurants in a given latitude and longitude range (e.g., restaurants within 3 km of a given latitude and longitude).

The implementation includes a "Use My Current Location" button. When clicked, it detects the user's current location and displays all restaurants within a 3 km radius.
